Fully 3D Printable configurable MOLLE letter plates

Originally came up with the idea for the Backpack Boosters contest on Printables.com, but then thought that I could make the process of printing out characters more streamlined with a Python script.

# How to use
Download and run the `configurator.py` script and it will query the amount of each character that you will need to print in order to make your desired sentence/phrase. This is assuming that you have a modern version of Python installed on your machine, if not then please install the latest stable release from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
